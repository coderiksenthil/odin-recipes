    <p>Dosas are a thin, savory crepe-like Indian pancake traditionally eaten for breakfast, but I like them anytime. These may not be very authentic, but they are a tasty alternative that appeals to the typical American pancake.</p>
    <li>2 cups durum wheat flour</li>

<li>1 cup brown rice flour</li>

<li>½ cup whole wheat flour</li>

<li>1 ½ cups water</li>
<li>1 red onion, finely chopped</li>
<li>1 red onion, finely chopped</li>
<li>1 cup brown rice flour</li>

<li>1 clove garlic, minced</li>

<li>¼ cup fresh cilantro, chopped</li>
<li>¼ teaspoon white sugar</li>
<li>½ teaspoon ground turmeric</li>
<li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
<li>2 teaspoons whole mustard seeds</li>
<li>1 teaspoon ground ginger</li>
<li>1 pinch cayenne pepper</li>
<li>3 tablespoons rice vinegar</li>
<li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>

<ol>
    <li>Stir the brown rice and whole wheat flours together in a mixing bowl. Stir in the water to make a thin batter. Add the onion, garlic, cilantro, sugar, turmeric, cumin, mustard seeds, cumin seeds, coriander, ginger, cayenne pepper and rice vinegar until evenly blended. Cover, and refrigerate for at least 1/2 hour, or overnight.</li>
    <li>To cook the dosas, heat the oil in a skillet over medium heat. Pour 1/4 cup of batter into the skillet, spreading it over the bottom in a thin layer. Cook 1 minute, turn, and cook 1 minute more. Remove from the pan. Repeat with remaining batter.

    <!--<li>Heat a dry skillet or tava over medium-high heat. Cook one roti at a time in the hot skillet until golden with some darker brown spots, about 1 minute per side, As it cooks, roll the next roti. Serve warm.
