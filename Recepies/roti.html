    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Roti bread is an unleavened griddle bread from India that is similar to pita bread. Ideally, I use a traditional Indian roti griddle called a tava.</p>
    <h2>Incredients</h2>
    <ul>
 <li>2 cups durum wheat flour</li>

<li>¾ cup water</li>

<li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>

<li>½ teaspoon salt</li>

<!--<li>and ground black pepper to taste</li>

<li> ½ pounds boneless, skinless chicken thighs, cut into bite-size pieces</li>

<li> tablespoons butter, divided</li>

<li>1 yellow onion, chopped</li>

<li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>

<li>1 tablespoon lemon juice</li>

<li>2 teaspoons chopped fresh ginger</li>

<li>1 cup tomato puree</li>

<li>1 cup half-and-half</li>

<li>¼ cup plain yogurt</li>

<li>⅓ cup cashews</li>

<li>1 bunch fresh cilantro, stems removed</li>-->


    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Stir flour, water, oil, and salt together in a medium bowl until well combined and pulling away from the sides. Turn dough out onto a well-floured surface and knead until smooth and pliable, about 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Divide dough into 12 equal pieces. Form each piece into a round. Working with one round at a time while all others are covered with a damp cloth, flatten with the palm of your hand, then use a rolling pin to roll into 6- to 8-inch diameter circle.

        </li>
        <li>Heat a dry skillet or tava over medium-high heat. Cook one roti at a time in the hot skillet until golden with some darker brown spots, about 1 minute per side, As it cooks, roll the next roti. Serve warm.

        <li>Stir tomato puree into onion mixture and cook, stirring frequently, about 2 minutes. Pour in half-and-half and yogurt. Reduce heat to low and simmer sauce, stirring frequently, about 10 minutes. Remove from heat.</li>
        <li>Blend cashews in a blender until finely ground. Add sauce to the blender; puree until smooth.</li>
        <li>Pour blended sauce over chicken in the skillet. Simmer until thickened, 10 to 15 minutes. Garnish with cilantro.</li>-->
